# Team Fortress 2 Theme Pack for KDE

A little theme pack I am working on, inspired by Valve's "Team Fortress 2" game. Will include font, sounds, colorscheme, wallpapers, and some miscellaneous KDE configs for like window borders and stuff.
NOTE: I don't have a lot of free time so this might not get updated very often, and might break at one point. If it does, just make an issue and I'll try to fix it when I can
